«The Java Core» quest is intended for those who have already received basic Java training (by completing CodeGym's Java Syntax quest).
Here you have to pass 10 fascinating levels where you will learn the basics of OOP, get acquainted with streams, serialization, and method overloading, and you'll learn a lot about interfaces and multiple inheritance.
The training is no longer as simple as the «Java Syntax» quest, but regular practice (by completing tasks) will help you pass all 10 levels in this quest, and you'll be ready to complete mini-projects in the near future.

Level 1 Basics of OOP: basic principles, inheritance, encapsulation
Level 2 Basics of OOP: overloading, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces
Level 3 Interfaces: comparison with an abstract class, multiple inheritance
Level 4 Type casting, instanceof. A big task involving interfaces
Level 5 Overloading methods, a feature of constructor calls
Level 6 Introduction to threads: Thread, Runnable, start, join, interrupt, sleep
Level 7 Introduction to threads: synchronized, volatile, yield
Level 8 Introduction to streams: InputStream/OutputStream, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
Level 9 Introduction to streams: Reader/Writer, FileReader/FileWriter
Level 10 Serialization
